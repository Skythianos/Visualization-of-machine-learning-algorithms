# Visualization-of-machine-learning-algorithms
This project
demonstrates common data mining algorithms,
and widely used visualization techniques, and methods to apply them together,
in order to get a feedback about the created models behaviour,
and this way it improve the efficiency and the speed of data analysis.
Furthermore, the project demonstrates the application of these methods on two different data sets.
